# Object-Detection-using-pycocotools
This project utilizes the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, an extensively annotated dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks. The goal of this project is to demonstrate object detection using the COCO dataset by visualizing the annotated objects in an image.

The project involves the following steps:

-Loading the COCO dataset annotations from a JSON file.      
-Selecting an image from the dataset.       
-Retrieving the image information and loading the image using OpenCV.     
-Fetching the annotations associated with the selected image.  
-Displaying the original image using Matplotlib.  
-Iterating over the annotations and drawing bounding boxes around the objects using OpenCV.  
-Adding labels with the object names to the bounding boxes.  
-Displaying the modified image with annotated objects using Matplotlib.'
